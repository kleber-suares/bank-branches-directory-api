# üè¶ Bank Branches Directory API

Banking Directory API is a REST API built with Spring Boot that manages the registration of bank branches along with their respective X and Y coordinates.

It allows users to store branch coordinates in an H2 database and perform queries that return the distance to registered branches, retrieved from a Redis cache or directly from the database when not cached.

When the cache is missing or expired, the data is fetched directly from the database, and a new cache is automatically created.

Cache entries are stored in JSON format for better readability and easier inspection through the Redis CLI.

## üöÄ Features

- Register and update bank branches
- Retrieve registered branches
- Query branches sorted by distance
- Caching mechanism using Redis for faster responses
- JSON serialization for human-readable cache entries
- Automatic cache refresh when expired or missing
- Basic authentication with preloaded users (admin/user)
- Automatic user initialization from application.yml via CommandLineRunner
- H2 console available at /h2-console for local development

## üîê Authentication

The API uses HTTP Basic Authentication.

Default credentials are automatically created at application startup and loaded from application.yml:
```yaml
app:
  users:
    - username: admin
      password: admin
      role: ADMIN
    - username: user
      password: user
      role: USER
```

Each user is stored in the H2 database at startup through a CommandLineRunner component (UserInitializer).

Example authentication for testing (via Postman or curl):
```console
curl.exe -u user:user "localhost:8080/branches/health"
```
üü° Expected OK response:
```console
Healthy! All up and running!
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Caching Details

The application uses Redis as the caching provider, with each cache entry having a configurable TTL (Time-To-Live) defined in application.yml.

Cached values are stored in JSON and can be inspected directly from Redis CLI.

---
üß± Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure Docker is installed and then follow the steps below to set up Redis.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Pull the Redis image:
```console
docker pull redis
```
2Ô∏è‚É£ Create and start a new container:
```console
docker run --name redis -p 6379:6379 -d redis
```
3Ô∏è‚É£ Access the container shell (optional):
```console
docker exec -it redis sh 
```
4Ô∏è‚É£ Test the connection with Redis CLI: (if running, server is expected to respond with PONG)
```console
redis-cli -h localhost -p 6379 ping
```
5Ô∏è‚É£ Exit the container shell:
```console
exit
```

üß™ Testing the Cache 

After running the application, you can test the caching behavior by following the steps below.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Make a GET request:
URL:
```yaml
localhost:8080/branches/distance?xCoord=-10.2&yCoord=4.5
```
üü° Expected response (empty array, since no branches have been stored yet):
```yaml
{
  "branchesList": []
}
```

2Ô∏è‚É£ Open Redis CLI 
```console
docker exec -it redis redis-cli
```
3Ô∏è‚É£ List cached keys 
```console
keys branchesDistances*
``` 
üü° Expected response:
```console
"branchesDistances::Coordinates(xCoord=-10.2, yCoord=4.5)"
```
Here, branchesDistances is the cache name, and
Coordinates(xCoord=-10.2, yCoord=4.5) is the cache key that Spring uses to store the data for the queried coordinates.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Check stored values 
```console
get "branchesDistances::Coordinates(xCoord=-10.2, yCoord=4.5)"
```
üü° Expected response (no value yet associated with the cache key):
```console
(nil)
```
5Ô∏è‚É£ Add a branch via POST request 

URL:
```yaml
localhost:8080/branches
  ```
Body:

```yaml
{
  "branchName": "BRANCH_1",
  "posX": -5.2,
  "posY": 3
}
```
6Ô∏è‚É£ Run the GET request twice:
- On the first call, data is retrieved from the H2 database and stored in Redis.
- On the second call (before cache expiration), data is retrieved directly from Redis.

üü¢ Expected response:
```yaml
{
  "branchesList": [
    {
      "branch": "BRANCH_1",
      "distance": 5.2201532544552744
    }
  ]
}
```
üí° Tip: After each GET request, you can also run 
```yaml
get "branchesDistances::Coordinates(xCoord=-10.2, yCoord=4.5)"
```
to confirm that the data has been cached in Redis. 

7Ô∏è‚É£ Check cache TTL

(The number returned represents the time remaining before expiration, in seconds.)
```console
ttl "branchesDistances::Coordinates(xCoord=-10.2, yCoord=4.5)"
```
